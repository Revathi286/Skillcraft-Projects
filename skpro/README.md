# Skillcraft-Projects
This repository contains projects I developed during my internship at Skillcraft, focusing on cybersecurity tools and solutions. Each project showcases my ability to design, implement, and refine technical tools independently.
Projects Included:

Caesar Cipher Tool:
A program implementing the Caesar Cipher algorithm, capable of encrypting and decrypting text. This project was part of my exploration of cryptography fundamentals.

Image Encryption Tool:
A simple tool that encrypts images by manipulating pixel values through operations such as swapping and applying mathematical transformations.

Password Strength Assessment Tool:
A program designed to evaluate the strength of passwords based on factors like length, complexity, and entropy.

Keylogger Program:
A basic keylogger that records and logs keystrokes, saving them to a file. This project highlights my understanding of system-level programming and ethical cybersecurity practices.
